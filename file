Here is the fully corrected step-by-step guide using proper DAX syntax for your Power BI setup:


---

üéØ Goal

Create a dropdown (1‚Äì7) that filters rows where insrt_ts is exactly that many days old from the latest insrt_ts value.


---

‚úÖ Step 1: Convert insrt_ts to DateTime

If insrt_ts is stored as text, create a new calculated column to convert it:

insrt_ts_converted = VALUE('table'[insrt_ts])

> This turns "7/2/2025 9:29:17 AM" into an actual datetime value usable in DATEDIFF.




---

‚úÖ Step 2: Create the DaysOld column

Now create another calculated column to get how many days old the record is compared to the latest timestamp:

DaysOld = DATEDIFF(
    'table'[insrt_ts_converted],
    CALCULATE(MAX('table'[insrt_ts_converted]), ALL('table')),
    DAY
)


---

‚úÖ Step 3: Create a supporting table for slicer

Create a new table with values from 1 to 7 for the dropdown:

DayFilterTable = GENERATESERIES(1, 7, 1)

This acts as a filter input for selection.


---

‚úÖ Step 4: Create a measure to filter based on selection

Now add a measure that reflects the number of rows exactly that many days old:

FilteredCount = 
VAR SelectedDay = SELECTEDVALUE(DayFilterTable[Value])
RETURN
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('table'),
    FILTER(
        'table',
        'table'[DaysOld] = SelectedDay
    )
)


---

‚úÖ Step 5: Add Slicer and Visual

1. Add a slicer visual ‚Üí drag DayFilterTable[Value] into it.


2. Use FilteredCount measure in any card/table/graph visual.


3. Or apply DaysOld = SelectedDay as a visual-level filter to show matching rows only.




---

‚úÖ Optional (for visual tables):

If you want the actual rows (not counts) shown:

Drag 'table' to a table visual.

Add a visual-level filter: 'table'[DaysOld] = DayFilterTable[Value]



---

Let me know if you want to make it relative to today instead of max date, or show the label as ‚Äú1 day ago‚Äù, ‚Äú2 days ago‚Äù, etc.
