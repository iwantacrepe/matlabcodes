Using BNY Mellon’s 2024 Annual Report, generate a 200-word summary that explains what BNY Mellon does in a way that a high school student can easily understand.

1. Clearly describe BNY’s strategic pillars and guiding principles in simple terms (avoid jargon).


2. Include a basic chart or diagram to help visualize BNY’s key business areas or pillars.


3. Use a creative analogy—like a fun story, school-related comparison, or game—to describe how BNY Mellon works as a whole. Make it engaging and memorable for a high school audience.



The tone should be educational, friendly, and engaging, like a cool teacher explaining finance.
Structure your output in 3 sections:

Part 1: The summary

Part 2: The chart

Part 3: The creative analogy
