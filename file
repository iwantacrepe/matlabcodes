Perfect 👍 — I’ll frame Slide 5 in the same forward‑looking, business‑focused tone, so it aligns with Slide 4.

Power BI Dashboard (Slide 5)

To complement the framework, I designed a Power BI dashboard that delivers immediate visibility into the migration’s status.

It provides stakeholders with a clear, real‑time snapshot of what is working and what requires attention.

It enables teams to pinpoint the exact source of discrepancies quickly, significantly reducing the time to resolution.

Beyond this migration, the dashboard serves as a replicable asset, offering a proven template that can streamline future data migration projects.


Together, the framework and dashboard create a comprehensive solution — ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and transparency throughout the migration process.

✅ Now all slides (2–5) are business‑like and consistent.

Do you want me to also give you a final stitched full script (Slides 1–5 in one flow) so you don’t have to piece them together?
