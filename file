You are absolutely right. Brevity is key for a powerful presentation slide. The text should be a headline that you can speak to, not a paragraph for the audience to read.
Here are the same four points, condensed into much shorter, punchier versions perfect for a slide.
Concise Content for Your Slide:
Introductory Paragraph (shorter version):
"Migrating our data from Vertica to Snowflake is a high-stakes initiative. A manual approach presents four unacceptable risks:"
1. Impossible Scale
 * (Icon: A mountain)
 * Text: Manual checks simply cannot scale to millions of records, which guarantees errors will be missed.
2. Silent Data Corruption
 * (Icon: A document with a red 'X')
 * Text: Subtle, hard-to-detect errors can corrupt critical data without any immediate warning signs, eroding trust.
3. Business Disruption
 * (Icon: A broken chain link)
 * Text: Flawed data directly threatens the accuracy of our business reports, dashboards, and applications.
4. High Costs & Inefficiency
 * (Icon: A clock with a dollar sign)
 * Text: Manual validation is a slow drain on valuable developer resources, and fixing errors post-migration is even more costly.
Remember: You can use your speaking notes to elaborate on each of these points with the details from the previous version. The slide should just provide the hook.
