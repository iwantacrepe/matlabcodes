Perfect — thanks for clarifying 👍. You want Slide 2 to stay professional and business-like, not too conversational. I’ll rewrite it so it feels like you’re presenting a structured business case rather than reading bullets.

Here’s the refined Slide 2 script in a business tone:

Why There Was a Need for This (Slide 2)

The migration presented several critical challenges. First, the sheer volume of data made manual checks impractical — scaling such efforts to millions of records would inevitably result in errors being overlooked. Second, there was the risk of silent data corruption, where subtle discrepancies could undermine the reliability of critical business data without immediate detection.

These issues posed a direct threat to business operations, as inaccurate data would compromise reports, dashboards, and decision-making systems. Additionally, manual validation represented a significant drain on developer productivity, with the cost of correcting issues post‑migration being even higher.

To address these risks effectively, an automated validation framework was essential.

Would you like me to align Slide 3–5 in the same business-like tone so your whole script feels consistent?
