As an Asset Servicing Intern at Bank of New York Mellon, I played a key role in the enterprise-scale modernization of BNY’s data infrastructure by designing and implementing robust data migration, validation, and monitoring frameworks to support the transition from Vertica to Snowflake.

Spearheaded the end-to-end data quality validation process across a complex network of over 500 interdependent tables and views, ensuring high-integrity schema alignment and granular row-level consistency.

Engineered a suite of dynamic Python-based automation scripts to programmatically generate and execute SQL for structural (DDL) comparison and deep content validation between legacy and modern data platforms.

Architected and deployed highly maintainable ETL pipelines using Pentaho Data Integration, leveraging shared services to support fault-tolerant, version-controlled, and scalable migration workflows.

Developed a fully interactive Power BI dashboard for visual anomaly detection, enabling stakeholders to explore schema mismatches, null pattern anomalies, and transformation exceptions via intuitive drill-downs and filters.

Implemented an intelligent mismatch tracking system by writing discrepancies directly to Snowflake-hosted audit layers, delivering real-time QA insights and traceability across multiple pipeline executions.

Collaborated cross-functionally with data engineers, QA analysts, and platform leads to refine error-handling strategies, optimize data flow orchestration, and ensure compliance with enterprise-grade data governance policies.
