Act as an expert business analyst creating a summary presentation for senior management.
Create a 5-page PowerPoint presentation about a 2-month internship project. The presentation's goal is to showcase the business value of an automated data validation framework built to support a major database migration from Vertica to Snowflake.
The tone should be professional and business-focused, not overly technical. Emphasize the "why" (the business problem) and the "so what" (the benefits and impact) rather than just the technical "how." Use a clean, modern design with relevant icons.
Here is the content and structure for each of the 5 slides:
Slide 1: Title Slide
 * Title: De-Risking Our Data Future: An Automated Validation Framework for the Snowflake Migration
 * Subtitle: Internship Project Showcase
 * Presenter Name: [Your Name]
 * Date: [Date of Presentation]
 * Visual: Include the BNY Mellon, Vertica, and Snowflake logos.
Slide 2: The Challenge & Our Strategic Solution
 * Title: The High-Stakes Challenge of Data Migration
 * Left Side - The Challenge (use a "problem" or "warning" icon):
   * Migrating enterprise data from Vertica to Snowflake is a critical initiative, but it carries significant risks.
   * Manual validation is not an option; it's too slow, prone to human error, and cannot scale to millions or billions of records.
   * Key Business Questions: How can we guarantee that no data is lost or corrupted? How do we ensure our business reports remain accurate after migration?
 * Right Side - The Solution (use a "solution" or "shield" icon):
   * I developed a fully automated Data Comparison Framework using Python.
   * This framework acts as a "digital auditor," systematically comparing the old and new databases to catch any errors before they impact the business.
   * The Goal: To enable a fast, reliable, and risk-free migration, ensuring 100% data integrity and stakeholder confidence.
Slide 3: How the Framework Guarantees Accuracy
 * Title: A Three-Layered Approach to Data Trust
 * Use three columns, each with a clear icon.
 * Column 1: Schema Validation (use a "blueprint" or "structure" icon)
   * What it does: Automatically compares the database "blueprints" (schemas, tables, and columns) between Vertica and Snowflake.
   * Business Benefit: Prevents application failures and data loading errors by ensuring the new database structure is a perfect mirror of the old one.
 * Column 2: Row-Level Data Verification (use a "magnifying glass" or "checklist" icon)
   * What it does: Meticulously compares the actual data, row-by-row, to find any discrepancies, missing records, or corrupted values. It intelligently ignores non-essential fields like timestamps.
   * Business Benefit: Provides definitive proof that customer and financial data is transferred with perfect accuracy, maintaining data integrity.
 * Column 3: Business Logic (View) Comparison (use a "gears" or "logic" icon)
   * What it does: Validates that complex data views—which often drive critical business reports—produce the exact same results in Snowflake as they did in Vertica.
   * Business Benefit: Ensures continuity for business intelligence and reporting. Stakeholders can trust that their dashboards and analytics are correct post-migration.
Slide 4: Impact and Value Delivered
 * Title: Driving Efficiency and Reducing Risk
 * Left Side - Key Features for Agility (use a "rocket" or "fast forward" icon):
   * Fully Automated: Frees up hundreds of developer hours from tedious manual checking.
   * Easily Configurable: The business or dev teams can easily control the validation rules using a simple Excel file—no code changes needed.
   * Scalable by Design: Built to handle massive datasets by processing them in efficient batches.
   * Centralized Mismatch Reporting: All discrepancies are automatically logged into a central audit table for fast resolution.
 * Right Side - Core Business Impact (use a "bullseye" or "growth chart" icon):
   * Accelerated Timelines: The speed of automated validation directly shortens the overall migration project timeline.
   * Drastically Reduced Risk: Minimizes the chance of post-migration data issues, which can be incredibly costly to fix.
   * Enhanced Stakeholder Confidence: Provides clear, data-driven proof that the migration is proceeding accurately and successfully.
Slide 5: Visualizing Success & The Path Forward
 * Title: From Data Points to Actionable Insights
 * Left Side - Interactive Power BI Dashboard (Include a conceptual image of a clean, modern dashboard):
   * Show a mock-up of a dashboard with key metrics:
     * "Tables Validated: 158/160"
     * "Data Mismatches: 12" (in red)
     * "Schema Mismatches: 0" (in green)
     * "Migration Health: 99.8% Accurate"
   * Text: To make the results accessible to all stakeholders, I created Power BI visualizations. These dashboards provide a simple, at-a-glance view of the migration's status, highlighting any issues that need attention.
 * Right Side - Conclusion & Key Takeaway:
   * This automated framework is more than a tool for a single project; it is a reusable strategic asset for BNY.
   * It establishes a best-practice for all future data migrations, ensuring they are consistently efficient, reliable, and secure.
   * Final Statement: We have successfully transformed data validation from a manual bottleneck into an automated, value-driving process.
