To create a dropdown (slicer) in Power BI that shows values 1 through 7, and filters the data to show only rows exactly that many days old compared to the latest insrt_ts date, follow these steps:


---

✅ Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Create a calculated column: DaysOld

Go to your table (let’s call it 'table') and add this calculated column:

DaysOld = DATEDIFF('table'[insrt_ts], CALCULATE(MAX('table'[insrt_ts]), ALL('table'])), DAY)

This computes how many days old each row is from the latest insrt_ts value in the table.



---

2. Create a separate table for slicer values: DayFilterTable

This table will contain the numbers 1 to 7:

DayFilterTable = GENERATESERIES(1, 7, 1)


---

3. Create a relationship (no join needed!)

Do NOT create a relationship between DayFilterTable and your main 'table'. Instead, we’ll use this table only for filtering via a measure.


---

4. Create a measure: FilteredCount (or any measure you want to display)

Example:

FilteredCount = 
VAR SelectedDay = SELECTEDVALUE(DayFilterTable[Value])
RETURN
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('table'),
    FILTER(
        'table',
        DATEDIFF('table'[insrt_ts], CALCULATE(MAX('table'[insrt_ts]), ALL('table'])), DAY) = SelectedDay
    )
)


---

5. Use a slicer on DayFilterTable[Value]

Add a slicer visual and select the DayFilterTable[Value] field.

This will now show a dropdown from 1 to 7.

When the user selects a number, only the data that is exactly that many days older than the latest insrt_ts will be shown in visuals where the FilteredCount measure is used.



---

✅ Optional: Apply Filter to Visual Table

If you want to show filtered table rows, not counts:

Use visual-level filters on your table or matrix.

Create a calculated column as shown in Step 1, and then add a visual filter like:


'DaysOld' is equal to DayFilterTable[Value]

This will dynamically filter rows based on the dropdown.

Let me know if you'd like to show this in a report page table or build a dynamic card, too.
