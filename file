What I Did (Slide 3)

To mitigate these risks, I developed a three‑layered validation framework.

At the first layer, the framework validated the DDL structures of all tables and views to confirm that the Snowflake schema precisely matched the source system’s architecture.

At the second layer, it performed row‑by‑row comparisons of tables to ensure that no records were lost or altered during migration.

At the third layer, it extended these validations to views, verifying that business logic and derived data remained consistent.


This structured approach ensured both architectural integrity and complete data accuracy across the migration.

Do you want me to also refine Slides 4 and 5 in the same style so your full script flows as a polished business presentation?
