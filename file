Prompt:
Act as a brand strategist challenged with making BNY exciting to a new generation. Your task is to write a 200-word summary for high school students that redefines BNY through a lens of technology and security.
Your summary must be built on this specific framework:
 * The Core Analogy (Innovation & Risk): Start by explaining BNY as the "Mission Control for the World's Money." Emphasize that BNY uses cutting-edge technology and AI not just to hold assets, but to provide the secure, intelligent platform that tracks, guides, and protects trillions of dollars for the world's biggest players. This establishes BNY as a tech-forward guardian.
 * The Pillars as Mission Directives: Briefly explain the three strategic pillars as BNY's core mission directives:
   * Be More for Clients: Giving clients the smartest data and tools for their financial missions.
   * Run the Company Better: Making Mission Control faster and more efficient through technology.
   * Power Our Culture: Ensuring the entire flight crew works as one team.
 * The Visual Blueprint: Include a simple Markdown chart that clearly links each "Mission Directive" (the pillar) to a key outcome.
The final output must be a dynamic, cohesive, and easy-to-understand summary that makes a legacy institution feel like a modern tech powerhouse.
