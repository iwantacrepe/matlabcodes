Yes, your updated compare_rows function correctly addresses the issue of excessive NULL rows when part of a composite key is missing by simplifying the mismatch reporting to a single line per missing key, while still handling actual data mismatches as expected.

‚úÖ What You‚Äôve Done Right:

1. Detects Entirely Missing Rows:

For rows with all compare columns missing in Vertica but present in Snowflake (or vice versa), you flag the entire row with "__KEY_MISSING__" and write a single concise message.

This avoids writing one row per column with "NULL"s, saving space and improving clarity.



2. Actual Mismatches Still Reported Column-Wise:

Your logic still loops over each compare_col and compares values individually.

Only adds mismatch if values differ and neither is NA, which is correct.



3. Key Representation:

"Key": row_keys is consistently built using available values from either _sf or _vt, ensuring traceability.

üîç Minor Suggestions for Enhancement:

To make it even more precise and robust:

1. Use strip() and casefold() uniformly in is_entirely_missing_* detection:

If string values are like " " or "N/A" (inconsistent formats), you might get false negatives. Update the condition to:

def is_empty(val):
    return pd.isna(val) or str(val).strip() == ""

Then:

is_entirely_missing_in_vt = all(is_empty(row.get(f"{col}_vt")) for col in compare_cols) and any(not is_empty(row.get(f"{col}_sf")) for col in compare_cols)
is_entirely_missing_in_sf = all(is_empty(row.get(f"{col}_sf")) for col in compare_cols) and any(not is_empty(row.get(f"{col}_vt")) for col in compare_cols)

2. Optional: Rename "__KEY_MISSING__" ‚Üí "Missing Composite Key" in ColumnName for clarity.

‚úÖ Final Verdict:

Your custom compare_rows() function is correct, well-designed, and ready to use. It improves readability, reduces file bloat, and helps focus on actionable mismatches without sacrificing any important information.
