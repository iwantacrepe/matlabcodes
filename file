Yes, you absolutely can, and it's an excellent way to simplify the Python code. You can modify the INSERT query to use Vertica's CAST function, which will automatically truncate the data to the specified size before insertion.
This approach moves the trimming logic from Python to the database, which is often cleaner. Vertica's CAST(string AS VARCHAR(255)) is byte-aware, so it correctly handles the original problem of multi-byte characters.
Step 1: Modify the INSERT Query
You need to wrap the placeholders for the value columns with a CAST function. The unique_key column should be left as-is to avoid trimming important key information.
For the compare_view script:
Update the insert_query inside the compare_view function like this:
            # The insert_query now uses CAST to let Vertica handle the trimming
            insert_query = """
                INSERT INTO ER1.vertica_snowflake_view_data_comparison
                (view_name, column_name, value_in_vertica, value_in_snowflake, unique_key)
                VALUES (%s, %s, CAST(%s AS VARCHAR(255)), CAST(%s AS VARCHAR(255)), %s)
            """

            with vt_dev_conn.cursor() as cur:
                cur.executemany(insert_query, data_to_insert)

For the compare_table script:
You would make the same change to the query in your other script:
            insert_query = """
                INSERT INTO ER1.vertica_snowflake_table_data_comparison
                (table_name, column_name, value_in_vertica, value_in_snowflake, unique_key)
                VALUES (%s, %s, CAST(%s AS VARCHAR(255)), CAST(%s AS VARCHAR(255)), %s)
            """

Step 2: Simplify Your Python Code
Now that Vertica handles the trimming, you can remove that logic from Python.
1. Simplify the format_value function:
It no longer needs to do any trimming. Change it back to a simple NULL check and string conversion.
def format_value(val):
    """Formats a value for insertion into the results table."""
    return "NULL" if pd.isna(val) else str(val)

2. Remove the trim_to_bytes function:
You can now completely delete the trim_to_bytes helper function from your script, as it's no longer needed.
This approach is cleaner, more efficient, and places the data conversion logic right where the constraint existsâ€”in the database itself.
