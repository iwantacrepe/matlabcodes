Good point 👍 — since you’re presenting this as part of your internship work, Slide 4 should be framed as the intended outcomes / business value delivered, not like a retrospective measurement.

Here’s the business‑like rewrite of Slide 4 in that context:


---

Driving Efficiency and Reducing Risk (Slide 4)

By implementing this framework, the organization is positioned to achieve several key outcomes:

Efficiency Gains – Developer time can be redirected from manual validation to higher‑value tasks, accelerating project delivery.

Risk Reduction – Automated checks identify and prevent costly data errors before they impact business operations.

Stakeholder Confidence – The framework provides clear, data‑driven evidence of a successful migration, building trust across teams and leadership.


These outcomes collectively ensure that the migration not only preserves data accuracy but also strengthens confidence in Snowflake as the new enterprise platform.

⚡ Question:
Do you also want me to tweak Slide 5 so it presents the Power BI dashboard as a forward‑looking enabler (like: what it allows teams to do), instead of sounding like a retrospective?
