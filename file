Understood perfectly. Thank you for the clarificationâ€”database views, not visual elements. That makes the description of your work even more precise.
Let's adjust the points to reflect that you are validating the DDL for both tables and views, and separately comparing the data from both. This is a very robust approach.
Here is a revised version that accurately captures this workflow.

Title: A Three-Point Validation Process
Introductory Paragraph:
"Our automated framework validates the migration at three distinct levels to ensure total technical integrity:"
(Use three concise boxes for your layout)
1. DDL & Schema Validation
 * (Icon Suggestion: A blueprint or a document with a checkmark)
 * Text: Verifies the DDL structure for all database objects, including tables and views, to ensure the new schema is an exact architectural match.
2. Table Data Audit
 * (Icon Suggestion: A table or spreadsheet)
 * Text: Audits the raw data. This performs a row-by-row comparison of all physical tables to guarantee zero data loss or corruption at the source.
3. View Data Comparison
 * (Icon Suggestion: A gear or a flow diagram)
 * Text: Checks the data output. This performs a row-by-row comparison of database views to confirm their results are identical after migration.
