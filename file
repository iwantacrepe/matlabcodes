Here's the final correct setup to implement a Power BI slicer that filters rows based on how many days old they are from the latest insrt_ts value.

Your goal:

> Show a dropdown (1–7), and when a number is selected, only rows exactly that many days older than the latest insrt_ts date are shown.

✅ Final Setup (Step-by-Step with Correct DAX)


---

🔹 Step 1: Create a Calculated Column

Name: DaysOld
Type: Calculated column in your main table (table)

DaysOld = 
VAR currentDate = CALCULATE(MIN('table'[insrt_ts]))
VAR latestDate = CALCULATE(MAX('table'[insrt_ts]), ALL('table'))
RETURN
DATEDIFF(currentDate, latestDate, DAY)

✅ What it does: For each row, it calculates how many days old it is from the latest date in the table.


---

🔹 Step 2: Create a Day Filter Table for the Slicer

Name: DayFilterTable
Type: New table (Modeling → New Table)

DayFilterTable = GENERATESERIES(1, 7, 1)

✅ What it does: Creates a list of numbers 1 to 7 to use in a slicer.


---

🔹 Step 3: Create a Filter Measure

Name: FilteredCount
Type: Measure (Modeling → New Measure)

FilteredCount = 
VAR selectedDay = SELECTEDVALUE(DayFilterTable[Value])
RETURN
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('table'),
    FILTER(
        'table',
        'table'[DaysOld] = selectedDay
    )
)

✅ What it does: Returns count of rows that are exactly N days old (where N is selected from the slicer).

🖼️ Final Visualization Setup in Power BI

1. Add a Slicer

Field: DayFilterTable[Value]

Slicer format: Dropdown


This gives the user options 1 through 7.


---

2. To Filter a Table Visual:

Add your data table to a visual.

Apply a visual-level filter:

'table'[DaysOld] is equal to DayFilterTable[Value]



This will dynamically show only the rows that match the selected number of days old.


---

3. To Show a Count or KPI Card:

Add a Card visual

Drag the FilteredCount measure


It will show the number of rows matching the selected day difference.

✅ Summary of Components

Name	Type	Purpose

DaysOld	Calculated Column	Calculates how many days old each row is
DayFilterTable	Table	Provides dropdown values 1–7 for slicer
FilteredCount	Measure	Counts rows that match selected DaysOld value
Slicer	Visual	Selects value from 1–7 to filter the data
Table/Matrix	Visual	Displays rows filtered by DaysOld
Card	Visual	Displays row count via FilteredCount

Let me know if you want to enhance this further by:

Showing “Today”, “Yesterday”, “3 Days Ago” instead of plain numbers.

Supporting “Older than 7 days” as a slicer option too.

Showing date labels dynamically.
