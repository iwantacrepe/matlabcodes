Thanks for the clarification, and based on your printouts and consistent Snowflake error:

> invalid identifier 'A."company_id"'



This clearly confirms the issue is with case-sensitive column handling in Snowflake. Specifically:


---

üîç Root Cause Recap:

Snowflake stores unquoted identifiers as uppercase by default, so:

company_id ‚Üí becomes COMPANY_ID

But if you quote an identifier like "company_id" or "Company_ID", then it's case-sensitive and must match exactly.

You're querying with:

a."company_id"

But that column in Snowflake is actually stored as:

"COMPANY_ID"

Hence the error.

‚úÖ Final Fix Strategy

Let me now give you the corrected and clean implementation of your code section that ensures:

1. ‚úÖ All column names used in SQL queries are taken directly from Snowflake/Vertica schema (case preserved).


2. ‚úÖ Any Excel column (e.g., company_id, Company_ID) is casefold-matched to the real column name (e.g., COMPANY_ID).


3. ‚úÖ No use of any col.lower() or col.casefold() in query building anymore ‚Äî only the resolved correct names are used.

‚úÖ Final Working Code

def resolve_columns(columns_from_excel, actual_columns):
    actual_map = {col.casefold(): col for col in actual_columns}
    resolved = []
    for col in columns_from_excel:
        key = col.casefold()
        if key not in actual_map:
            raise ValueError(f"[ERROR] Column '{col}' not found in actual schema.")
        resolved.append(actual_map[key])
    return resolved

def build_outer_join_query(table, columns, keys, filter_col=None):
    select_parts = []

    # Main column SELECTs
    for col in columns:
        select_parts.append(f'a."{col}" AS "{col}_sf"')
        select_parts.append(f'b."{col}" AS "{col}_vt"')

    # Keys - add coalesce only once for join keys
    for k in keys:
        select_parts.append(f'COALESCE(a."{k}", b."{k}") AS "{k}"')

    select_clause = ", ".join(select_parts)
    join_clause = " AND ".join([f'a."{k}" = b."{k}"' for k in keys])

    query = f'''
        SELECT {select_clause}
        FROM "{SCHEMA}"."{table}" a
        FULL OUTER JOIN "{SCHEMA}"."{table}" b
        ON {join_clause}
    '''

    if filter_col:
        query += f'''
            WHERE COALESCE(a."{filter_col}", b."{filter_col}")
            BETWEEN '{START_DATETIME}' AND '{END_DATETIME}'
        '''

    return query

‚úÖ Example Usage in Your Flow

Replace your compare_table() section like this:

actual_sf_cols = get_columns_from_snowflake(table)
actual_vt_cols = get_columns_from_vertica(table)

compare_cols = resolve_columns(config['columns_to_compare'], actual_sf_cols)
key_cols = resolve_columns(config['keys'], actual_sf_cols)

print(f"[DEBUG] Final Compare Columns: {compare_cols}")
print(f"[DEBUG] Final Key Columns: {key_cols}")

query = build_outer_join_query(table, compare_cols, key_cols, config.get('filter_column'))

print(f"[INFO] Running query for table: {table}")
print(query)

sf_cursor.execute(query)


---

üß™ Optional: Enforce strict casing on Snowflake to simulate issues

Try running this query manually in Snowflake Web UI:

SELECT "company_id" FROM "ER1"."CLIENT_PROFILE_INFO"

‚ùå This will fail unless the column was actually created in lowercase (which is rare).
‚úÖ This will always work:

SELECT "COMPANY_ID" FROM "ER1"."CLIENT_PROFILE_INFO"
