Prompt:
Act as an expert financial communicator skilled at making complex topics simple and engaging for teenagers.
Your mission is to generate a 200-word summary explaining what the company BNY (The Bank of New York Mellon) does for a high school audience.
Your response must seamlessly integrate the following four elements:
 * A Creative Analogy: Begin with an engaging analogy to explain BNY's core business. Frame it as a "financial world librarian and locksmith." BNY doesn't own the books (assets), but it keeps a perfect catalog of who owns what, protects them in a high-tech vault, and ensures they are safely transferred when traded, just like a librarian manages and protects valuable books for a huge community.
 * Strategic Pillars Explained: Clearly and simply explain BNY's three strategic pillars:
   * Be More for Clients
   * Run the Company Better
   * Power Our Culture
 * Simple Visualization: Create a simple Markdown chart that connects each pillar to a real-world goal that a student can understand.
 * Cohesive Summary: Weave these elements together into a single, flowing summary under 200 words. The tone should be accessible and avoid jargon.
The goal is to produce a clear, creative, and comprehensive overview of BNY in a brief format.
